            <div class="place">
                <h2 class="place-header">5. Real Madrid</h2>
                <img src="images/RealMadrid.jpg" class="place-img">
                <p class="place-p">Last Years UEFA Champions League champions continued their good form this season. Despite losing the Laliga title to their fierce rivals, F.C. Barcelona, they did end up coming out victorious in the Copa del Rey. Their Champions League run was ended against the fierce Machester City in the Semi-Finals. Many standout Real Madrid players such as Vinicious Jr. and Karim Benzema have cemented themselves as some of the top players in the world this season, so don't be shocked if Real Madrid do something massive next season!</p>

            <div class="place">
                <h2 class="place-header">4. Napoli</h2>
                <img src="images/Napoli.jpg" class="place-img">
                <p class="place-p">Serie A has recently become a more competitive league, after Juventus club legends have left, leaving the path for several Italian teams to take the Serie A title. Despite some of the best teams in the world; Inter Milan, AC Milan, and Lazio to name a few, Napoli absolutely blew every Italian team out of the water. Winning the league by an astronomical 16 points, Napoli snatched their first Serie A title since 1990! Napoli's star player, Victor Osimhen was the leagues top scorer with an impressive 26 goals.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="place">
                <h2 class="place-header">3. Bayern Munich</h2>
                <img src="images/Bayern.jpeg" class="place-img">
                <p class="place-p">Bayern Munich lost their best player, Robert Lewandowski last year, but that didn't stop Bayern from continuing to dominate German soccer. Despite a rather close finish, Bayern Munich just about snatched the Bundesliga title from Borussia Dortmund for their eleventh German league title in a row. Bayern also won the German Supercup, and despite a wonderfull Champions League groupstage performance, their journey came to an end, after their efforts were dismissed by a lethal Manchester City side. After Lewandowski's departure, there will need to be some adjusting at Bayern, but don't count them out just yet, as no team in Europe can ever get comfortable when playing against Bayern Munich.</p>

            <div class="place">
                <h2 class="place-header">2. Inter Milan</h2>
                <img src="images/Inter.jpg" class="place-img">
                <p class="place-p">Despite finishing third in the Serie A behind Napoli and Lazio, Inter Milan were able to win both Italian cups. Their run in the Champions League was very impressive, as they qualified from the Group of Death. From then, they were able to defeat derby rivals, AC Milan in the Champions League semi-finals to make it to the Final. They could very well be crowned as the European Champions this season!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="place">
                <h2 class="place-header">1. Manchester City</h2>
                <img src="images/ManCity.jpg" class="place-img">
                <p class="place-p">After signing Erling Haaland this season, Manchester City have been an unstoppable team this season with their several star players. Despite being in an eleven point deficit behind Arsenal at the top during winter, Manchester City were able to make a massive comeback, and claim their third Premier League title in a row. They also defeated derby rivals Manchester United in the FA Cup Final. After a fantastic Champions League campaign knocking out both Bayern Munich and Real Madrid, Manchester City are the favorites to win the final, and make it a treble in the 2022-23 season.</p>

            <div class="place">
                <h2 class="place-header">5. Harry Kane</h2>
                <img src="images/Kane.jpg" class="place-img">
                <p class="place-p">Harry Kane's future at Tottenham has been questioned for a long time this season. Kane's first part of the season was unfortunate, especially at the World Cup, where he missed a crucial penalty, causing England to be knocked out by France in the quarter finals. However, Kane's been continuing to dominate Premier League defences, scoring 30 goals this Premier League season. Whether or not he plays for Tottenham, or another team such as Manchester United next season, Kane is always a striker to be terrified of from an opposing perspective.</p>

            <div class="place">
                <h2 class="place-header">4. Kevin De Bruyne</h2>
                <img src="images/DeBruyne.jpg" class="place-img">
                <p class="place-p">Kevin De Bruyne is quite definately the best midfielder in the world right now, and one of the best of all time. After Erling Haaland joined Manchester City, De Bruyne and Haaland have continuously linked up to terrify all English and European defences. De Bruyne was the top assister this season yet again, with an astounding 16 assists!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="place">
                <h2 class="place-header">3. Kylian Mbappe</h2>
                <img src="images/Mbappe.jpg" class="place-img">
                <p class="place-p">Mbappe has continued to assert himself as one of Europe's top goalscorers this season. His World Cup campaign this season was magnificent, as he scored an impressive 8 goals, including a hattrick in the final, which was a feat only ever accomplished by the great Pele. Despite eventually losing the final, Mbappe was definately one of the most in form players this season, and a Ballon D'Or in the future seems very likely for the young Frenchman.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="place">
                <h2 class="place-header">2. Erling Haaland</h2>
                <img src="images/Haaland.jpg" class="place-img">
                <p class="place-p">Wow! Just wow! Erling Haaland silenced every hater he had, and proved that he could score wherever he played. People thought that he could only perform in a "farmers league", but after joining Manchester City this season, Erling Haaland shattered the previous goal record, scoring an astonishing 36 goals in the 2022-23 Premier League season! He is also the current top goal scorer in the Champions League with an impressive 12 goals. Is there anyone who can stop this goal-scoring machine?</p>

            <div class="place">
                <h2 class="place-header">1. Lionel Messi</h2>
                <img src="images/Messi.jpg" class="place-img">
                <p class="place-p">Once again, the greatest soccer player the world has every seen, was able to add another title to his illustrious trophy case. Haters of Messi stated that he couldn't perform on the international stage. Messi lost the 2014 World Cup final against Germany, but this year, Messi's Argentina were able to dominate the world. In the final, they played against the current world champions, France, in what can only be described as, The Best World Cup Final Match Ever! Messi ended up winning his first World Cup, and Argentina's third, and as he was named the player of the tournament, he finally asserted himself as the greatest of all time.</p>
