                <h2 class="place-header">How is this list created?</h2>
                <p class="place-p">This list is based off of my own opinions, and is welcomed to be debated upon. I made my list not through personal preferences, but rather based on stats, facts, and performances. First of all, I drew up a pool of thirty candidates from each category, and identified their stats, and comments that were made about each candidates performances. There are definately other great teams and players that may have deserved to be on this list, but I ended up narrowing it down to just five teams and five players for each sport.</p>

                <h2 class="place-header">Possible mistakes?</h2>
                <p class="place-p">When making a top five list, there are several common mistakes that can occur. First, overlooking important criteria or factors that should be considered when ranking items can lead to an imbalanced or incomplete list. Second, failing to research or gather enough information about each item can result in biased or uninformed choices. Third, personal biases or preferences can influence the rankings, potentially neglecting objective evaluation. Fourth, not providing clear and specific criteria for the rankings can lead to confusion or subjective interpretations. Lastly, excluding or forgetting deserving items can happen if there's insufficient consideration of the broader scope or range of options. It's important to be mindful of these potential pitfalls and approach top five lists with thoroughness and objectivity.</p>
